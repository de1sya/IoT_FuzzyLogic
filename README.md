# IoT_FuzzyLogic (End of Semester Group Project)
Simulation of Fuzzy Logic implementation on IoT to control RPM of an Air Conditioner based on Temperature and Humidity value.

Requirements :
- NodeMCU
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires
- Potentiometer 2x
- Multiplexer IC
- Blynk

Temperature and Humidity value are represented by two potentiometers.
Since NodeMCU has only one analog pin, we needed multiplexer to use two potentiometers.
